# python-port-scanner
Small port scanner utility written in python


## Usage

1. `python3 scanner.py` from your preferred environment that python3 is installed in
2. The program will then prompt you for a target IP to scan. A good target to test is [scanme.nmap.org](http://scanme.nmap.org/)
    
    - you can find the IP for that address by using `ping scanme.nmap.org`
